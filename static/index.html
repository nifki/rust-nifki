    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>Click in the game to make sure it has the focus, then use the arrow
    keys to move the man around. If you ever owned a BBC micro you will know
    the rules, otherwise you have the fun of working them out. Hint: collect
    all the diamonds. If you get stuck, press Escape to restart the level, or
    reload the page to start again from the first level. The levels
    <em>are</em> all possible, but they get increasingly difficult towards the
    end. Have fun!</p>

    <h2>What is Nifki?</h2>

    <p>Nifki is a wiki that allows you to write games like this. You can edit
    the source code and the instructions over the web, then click on a button
    to get a version of your game that you can embed in any web page. This
    game is about 500 lines long.</p>

    <p>Nifki was originally written using Java applets, and that version has
    been <a href="http://nifki.net/">live</a> since about 2006. Meanwhile,
    Java applets stopped working in most browsers, so we're rewriting using
    Javascript/HTML5, which is now sufficiently reliable. This is a demo of
    the new version.</p>
